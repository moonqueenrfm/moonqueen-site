<br/>32-DNB POWERPUFFGIRL GROOVE<br/>I know I've got to keep moving, keep moving through the changes<br/>I know I think too much<br/>I know I'll still make it<br/> <br/>Cause when I trust myself<br/>Even if it doesn't sound right<br/>At least I feel it for myself<br/>And it'll come out fine<br/> <br/>I've tried settling so very very hard,<br/>I find being a good person, hasn't got me very far<br/><br/>Only when I'm fucked up and stand up for myself<br/>Do i strike some kind of balance,<br/>Between nice and giving hell<br/> <br/>GRUNGE FUSION<br/>I don't care if i go very far<br/>I'd rather be myself than have sold my soul for art<br/>Like Kafka sit and sing for years<br/>Right here and on the ground<br/> <br/>And if i stop thinking so much about myself and my hands i think<br/>Something might just come for me<br/>Something might just comfort me<br/><br/>And i don't know if these tears are fear pain or pleasure<br/>🔜<br/>JAZZ FEEL<br/>Might eat another shroom popsicle<br/>Take more psychedelics i call it<br/>Mental health, spiritual wealth, a brief reprieve from this emotional well<br/>Can't get away from myself<br/> <br/>I don't have the hang of life yet<br/>I got my fishnets on and the art's on the walls, finally<br/>And I'm not taking your calls<br/>Stop calling me<br/>  <br/>JDILLA<br/>My friend told me to self isolate and I know he might have well intentions<br/>But part of me thinks that he's full of shit<br/>And I wanna go out, get drunk n<br/>Be with the people and see what life's about<br/> <br/>There might be so much taint inside but I'm ready to feel the change<br/>Outside of my room, touch on the other parts of my life<br/> <br/>And i haven't had sex in 3 months<br/>I'm sick of that shit and i know it's not good for me too<br/>I don't wanna just fuck somebody and use them like<br/>A little mastur-bear-tory tool<br/><br/>SAMBA<br/>Won't you be my lovely sex toy<br/>Won't you be my new distraction<br/>There's so much spiritual work I've yet to do<br/>And I've still gotta do but I'd like to get some action<br/> <br/>Oooh they just closed the bar i used to work at, they said it's full of criminals<br/>I guess that's just you and me my friend<br/>We're all Here full of ourselves<br/> <br/>Not sure if what we're doing is right or wrong at least I'm trying to see<br/>Stop breaking at least<br/>I've stopped saying my mom is the worst thing that<br/>Title belongs to my ex, fuck you you deserved it<br/> <br/>And there's nothing more that i can do but let loose<br/>Just hope for the best as i try to follow the rules<br/> <br/>BLASTBEAT/METAL<br/>Other people have it out for me,<br/>The ones i see in ruts<br/>But the wisest thing I've read is that the truth is lived not taught so<br/> <br/>I might get on your nerves and sound like shit in your ears and in my head but i guess<br/>At least I'll still have an empty conscience<br/><br/>32bars STACCATO/purdie SHUFFLE<br/><br/>HOUSE DISCO<br/>Oooh fuck you, so many words that I've said<br/>They're all the truth<br/>I've gotta find<br/> what truth I've selected<br/> <br/>My stupid deft fingers can't do wrong with clarity but I'd like to<br/>Pass them the secret between you and me<br/>But it never happens<br/>You're never single at the same time as i am, and now that we both are it seems God has other plans<br/>You're never single at the same time as i am, feels like my entire life is a collection of other people's Missed Quonnections<br/> <br/>TRAP BEAT/REGGAE<br/>I never took part in all the truths I could have shared<br/>It took, 20 years, 28 years<br/> <br/>🔜<br/>So much thinking in my head it doesn't let my hell speak<br/>Read the truth that lies within me<br/> <br/>When i close my eyes and follow through my heart<br/>Something might just come out or fall apart<br/> <br/>I've always been afraid of the destructive power of the truth<br/>The matter itself and the method i had chosen<br/>You can always count on a poet to tell the truth<br/>I'm somewhat of a poet, i smoke sages too<br/>See, the power of memory:<br/>It doesn't matter cause you're not gonna remember listen to me it's not me it's you<br/> <br/>Stop Letting the intellect rule your heart<br/>Maybe step into the wisdom of your body you'll go far<br/> <br/>TOM GROOVE<br/>Give her slack<br/>It never comes as easy for me as it does for you<br/>I might feel so much jealousy in my heart<br/>It's only because all the times I've told the truth<br/>I've been turned away and torn apart<br/>I'll just gonna wait for my time in the sun<br/>Got to keep believing, oooh here it comes!<br/> <br/>I was cine-mad<br/>I'd like to sing pretty things but i<br/>Have a cache to clear<br/>So much pain before I d(ie)o<br/> <br/>Learn to practice more<br/>And let the roses come my way<br/>Cause I've got to learn to trust myself<br/> learn to look away<br/> <br/>ACTUAL FUSION<br/>Soft folding in to the glory of my mind<br/>She’s always going be back trying to keep me from flying hiiiiigh<br/>As i look at all my books<br/>I think of all the thieves the liars and the crooks<br/>The ones who take from me and say i am not enough<br/>But i know that iiiii<br/>Just can't give up<br/><br/>Of my flight i<br/>Get this sort of peace RIT<br/>Slow myself down<br/>And love to feel release<br/> <br/>PROGRESSIVE 5/4<br/>FAUX END-HALF TIME<br/>You are prosperous<br/>I live to see the light<br/>That's reflected in your eyes<br/> <br/>When you catch me staring at a mic<br/>Finally see myself as more than just a mind<br/> <br/>Oh I'm always almost halfway there<br/>Cause one half of the work is knowing<br/>And the other half is really<br/>caring to do the motherfuckin woooork<br/> <br/>WHAT I CAN’T HAVE<br/> <br/>🌬️CHORUS🌬️<br/>B∆7		  E∆7<br/>I'm so
